# WeatherApp
A simple weather app for testing Tkinter library and API communication.

The app gets data via API openweathermap.org. Data are displayed via GUI made with Tkinter library. User has an option to input a city
and gets its weather data after submit button click. There is a folder with weather icons in this repository which are also displayed
via GUI based on weather data.
